NAME
----

saldl - a CLI downloader with unique primed features based on libcurl.


SYNOPSIS
--------

*{manname}* <<OPTIONS>> 'URL'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*{manname}* is a CLI downloader based on libcurl. +

By default, it splits a download into  fixed-sized chunks and download
them in-order with multiple concurrent connections.

Many <<OPTIONS,OPTIONS>> are available to change the default behavior.


Files and Dirs
---------------

'<filename>.part.sal'::
  The incomplete/partial file that will eventually be renamed to '<filename>'.

'<filename>.ctrl.sal'::
  This file contains the minimal information required about the download
  progress to allow resuming.

'<filename>.tmp.sal/'::
  By default, *{manname}* uses temporary files to store chunks before they are
  merged. Those files are created in this dir.


Chunk Progress States
----------------------

*4*::
  Chunk already merged in '<filename>.part.sal'

*3*::
  Chunk downloaded, but still not merged. +
  +
  This state should be transient. If it's not, your system might have
  load problems. Otherwise, you might benefit from storing chunks in
  memory buffers as detailed in
  <<temp-files_vs_mem-bufs,*Temporary Files vs. Memory Buffers*>>.

*2*::
  Chunk download is in progress.

*1*::
  Chunk is queued for download. +
  +
  This is a transient state you shouldn't see.
  Unless you have serious load/congestion problems in your system.

*0*::
  Chunk still not queued for download.

[NOTE]
=============
When resuming from a previous session, an incomplete chunk would
initially have state '0'. That doesn't mean it will be emptied and
downloaded from scratch. Sub-chunk resume will work as expected.
=============


[[OPTIONS]]
OPTIONS
---------

[[gen-opts]]
General
~~~~~~~~

*-d, --dry-run*::
  do not download, only display information. 

*-m, --memory-buffers*::
  Use memory buffers instead of temp files for downloading chunks. +

  Increase verbosity level. +
  (See <<v-levels,*Verbosity Levels*>> for details.)

*-C, --no-color*::
  Disable colors in output. +
  Pass it twice (*-CC*) to disable all other formattings
  (auto-set if not tty).

*--no-status*::
   Disable progress status output. (For debugging purposes only)

Resume Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*-r, --resume*::
  resume download. +
  (requires a '<filename>.ctrl.sal' to exist with a matching filesize)

*-f, --force*::
  If not resuming, and '<filename>.part.sal' exists, truncate the file
  and start over.

[[ch-sz-conn]]
Chunk sizes and connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*-S, --single*::
  a single chunk single connection mode (wget-like). 

*-s 'size', --chunk-size='size'*::
  Set size for chunks in bytes. <<unit-suf,*A unit suffix*>> can
  be used.
  (*default*: '1m')

*-c 'num', --connections='num'*::
  number of concurrent connections.
  (*default*: '6')

*-l 'num', --last-chunks-first='num'*::
  the number of last chunks that should be downloaded first. 
  (*default*: '0')

*-a 'num', --auto-size='num'*::
  modify chunk size so that chunk progress can fit in 'num' lines. 

*-w, --whole-file*::
  work like typical download accelerators
  (no. of chunks = no. of connections).


Filename Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*-o 'filename', --output-filename='filename'*::
  Use this filename instead of the detected name.

*-n, --no-path*::
  assume path is relative, replace '/' and ':' with '_'. 

*-D 'dirname', --root-dir='dirname'*::
  Prepend filename with this path.

*-G, --keep-GET-attrs*::
  keep GET attributes at the end of a filename.
  (This option has no effect if *-o*/*--output-filename* is used)

*-A, --no-attachment-detection*::
  Do not use Content-Disposition attachment filename if present. 

*-t, --auto-trunc*::
  truncate filename if name or path is too long. 

*-T, --smart-trunc*::
  same as *-t/--auto-trunc* but tries to keep the file extension.
  (overrides *-t*/*--auto-trunc*) 


Network Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*-R 'bandwidth', --connection-max-rate='bandwidth'*::
  maximum rate per connection in bytes/s. <<unit-suf,*A unit suffix*>>
  can be used.
  (*default*: '0' [unlimited])

*-O, --no-timeouts*::
  disable all timeouts. 

*-x 'proxy', --proxy='proxy'*::
  set proxy. 

*-X 'proxy', --tunnel-proxy='proxy'*::
  similar to --proxy but tunneling all traffic through it. 

*-N, --no-proxy*::
  disable all proxies even if set in the environment. 

*--skip-TLS-verification*::
  Skip TLS/SSL verification. Use at your own risk.


Custom Request Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*-E, --auto-referer*::
  auto set referer in case of a redirect. 

*-e 'referer', --referer='referer'*::
  set referer. 

*-K 'cookie-file', --cookie-file='cookie-file'*::
  File to read cookies from .

*-k 'cookies', --inline-cookies='cookies'*::
  Set cookies.

*-p 'post-data', --post='post-data'*::
  Send 'post-data' in a simple POST request (no multipart).

*-P 'raw-post-data', --raw-post='raw-post-data'*::
  Send 'raw-post-data' as-is including headers (supports multipart).

*-U, --no-user-agent*::
  Don't set user agent (disables default agent).

*-u 'agent', --user-agent='agent'*::
  set user agent.

The following settings should not be generally used, but might help in rare
cases:

*-H, --use-HEAD*::
  Use 'HEAD' instead of 'GET' to retrieve download information from
  servers.

*-I, --no-remote-info*::
  Just 'GET'. Don't do anything else.
  (*-S*/*--signle* is forced, *-r*/*--resume* is disabled)

*-F, --assume-partial-support*::
  Don't use this. The wrong data will probably be download.

ENVIRONMENT
------------

In addition to all environment variables affecting *libcurl(3)*.
The following variable(s) can affect *{manname}*:

*SALDL_EXTRA_ARGS*::
  Append these arguments to argv.


[[unit-suf]]
Unit Suffixes
-------------

<<OPTIONS,OPTIONS>> that take an argument representing a byte value
can be suffixed with one of the following letters:

 ;;
  *K* or *k*::
    multiply size by 1024 (KiB).
  *M* or *m*::
    multiply size by 1024*1024 (MiB).
  *G* or *g*::
    multiply size by 1024*1024*1024 (GiB).

[[v-levels]]
Verbosity Levels
------------------

*{manname}* only shows essential information with the default verbosity
level. You can pass <<ui-opts,*-V*/*--verbosity*>> multiple times to
increase verbosity.

[NOTE]
===============
Verbosity levels are incremental. Each level includes all messages from
lower levels.
===============

*-V*::
  Show non-fatal errors.

*-VV*::
  Show warnings.

*-VVV*::
  Show informational messages.

[WARNING]
==============
The following levels are noisy. They should only be used for
debugging/tracing purposes.
==============
 
*-VVVV*::
  Show debug messages.

*-VVVVV*::
  Enable verbose output in libcurl.

*-VVVVVV*::
  Show debug messages from event loops.


[[temp-files_vs_mem-bufs]]
Temporary Files vs. Memory Buffers
-----------------------------------

By default, *{manname}* stores chunks in temporary files. Until they
are fully downloaded. Then, *{manname}* merges those completed chunks
in '<filename>.part.sal', and deletes the temporary files.

This approach allows us to have sub-chunk resumability. And we avoid
losing any already downloaded data in case of a failure or interruption.

This works very well in most cases. But there exists scenarios
where this approach is clearly suboptimal.

Suppose you have one of those cheap NAND flash memory devices. Or you
are using a network file-system. Or your network speed is so fast
that your storage device can't keep up. In those cases, it is advisable
to avoid any IO activity that is not absolutely necessary.

To optimize for those scenarios, *{manname}* can use memory buffers
(the option <<gen-opts,*-m/--memory-buffers*>>) instead of temporary
files. But this comes at a cost of losing sub-chunk resumability and
memory overhead. So, use this option wisely. You should definitely not use
this option with <<ch-sz-conn,*-w/--whole-file*>>.

[NOTE]
============
If <<ch-sz-conn,Single mode>> is enabled, downloaded data is written
directly to '<filename>.part.sal'
============


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Success

*1*::
   A 'fatal' error happened. A helpful message should explain the message.
