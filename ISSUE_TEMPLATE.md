 If you have an issue with compiling saldl, please make sure that:
  1- You have all the dependencies installed with at least the minimum
     version required, and including development headers.

  2- If generating the manual page fails, make sure both asciidoc and
     docbook-xsl are installed.

 If saldl fails at runtime. Try increasing the verbosity level step-by-step.
 If the output becomes too noisy, you can redirect it to a file and attach it:
   saldl [arguments] -VVVVVV 2> saldl.log
--->

### saldl -v

### Describe the issue / How to reproduce

### log output (if needed)
